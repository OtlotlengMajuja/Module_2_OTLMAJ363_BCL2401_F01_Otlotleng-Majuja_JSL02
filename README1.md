# JSL02: Debugging the DOM
# Introduction
The task was to debug a fitness app by preventing users from adding the same fitness goal more than once.

# Elements Included
Functions, DOM manipulation, event listeners, conditional logic, variable declaration, and form submission handling.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
**Error Handling:** I was able to display proficiency in error handling, shown in the addNewGoal function where duplicate goals are detected and an alert is displayed to the user to prevent unintended actions.
**User Interaction and Feedback:** Providing user interaction and feedback through alerts (alert) and dynamically updating content to reflect changes (e.g., updating water intake display, progress charts).

# Challenges Faced
Being unsure of what function would work for me in order to manipulate the DOM appropriately. 

# Overall Learning Experience
This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of modern JavaScript syntax and its advantages in terms of readability and conciseness, by observing the use of ES6 features like arrow functions, const declarations, and template literals. Along with understanding how to provide feedback to users, by displaying alerts or updating content dynamically.
