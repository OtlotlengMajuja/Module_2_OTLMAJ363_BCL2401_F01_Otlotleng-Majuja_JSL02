# JSL02: Debugging the DOM
# Introduction
The task was to debug a fitness app by preventing users from adding the same fitness goal more than once.

# Elements Included
Functions, DOM manipulation, event listeners, conditional logic, variable declaration, and form submission handling.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
**Error Handling:** I was able to display proficiency in error handling, shown in the addNewGoal function where duplicate goals are detected and an alert is displayed to the user to prevent unintended actions.
**User Interaction and Feedback:** Providing user interaction and feedback through alerts (alert) and dynamically updating content to reflect changes (e.g., updating water intake display, progress charts).
